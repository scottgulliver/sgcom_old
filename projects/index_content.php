				<i>"Simple yet comprehensive money management app. Use it to track daily expenses, see where your money is going, and get an overview of all of your accounts."</i>
			</p>
			<p>After looking for a simple and user-friendly money management app for my own use, I was
				unable to find one which I liked on the Google Play store. I decided to make an app that
				focused on being easy to use, and which allowed for quick entry of data. Since the first
				version was released, further features have been added in an effort to keep it competitive
				with other apps in the store.</p>
