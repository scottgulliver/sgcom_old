		<p>At Magnetic North, I formed part of a development team which developed cloud-based contact centre 
			solutions, including call recording, predictive dialling, and PCI compliance packages. Alongside 
			developing & supporting the existing products, I also spearheaded a small team to develop a new 
			product. This was a new venture for the company, and as such it was important that it was created 
			quickly, to a high standard, and would stand up against competing software. We delivered this 
			project on time, to budget, and to a high standard.</p>
